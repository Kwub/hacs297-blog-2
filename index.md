# Teamwork and Inclusion

## Showing Up

I believe strongly that feeling comfortable is essential to contributing to any team. If you can't speak up when you have an idea or a critique, then advancement within a team is impossible. The best ideas come from discussion and refinement. Failure to cultivate an open environment actively hampers the potential of the team. However, creating a situation where every employee feels like they can "show up" adequately is difficult. Mixing people of different identities in the same environment is very difficult. Conflict is nearly inevitable. This creates an optimization problem: maximizing diversity of ideas while minimizing catastrophic conflict. I do not think that this is a solved problem, but certain constraints can help find suitable solutions. Firstly, when developing a company culture, ability to accept the ideas of others should be paramount. If a company is built up of people who are incapable of taking suggestions from others, then cultivating a team with diverse perspectives is pointless. Beyond an ability to accept different ideas, all employees need to be able to accept people of different backgrounds. Conflict will arise more often if team members cannot tolerate or adapt to working closely with people with different experiences and ways of expressing themselves.

Even if a team is selected to mirror these traits and they are selected from a diverse set of backgrounds, creative iteration will not occur without a culture of open discussion. Shifting a company's culture seems to me to be a challenge proportional to the size of the company. Smaller companies can more easily monitor the behavior of their employees and make large changes quickly. Larger companies will need more time and more directed efforts to change something as pervasive as culture. Trainings, meetings, and other coercive measures may be necessary. Even with all of this effort, sometimes changing culture means changing personnel. This does not mean that old employees need to be let go without reason, but it does mean that this culture shift should be a focus of hiring decisions. Over time, this demographic change can shift the culture in the desired direction.

## The Optimal Outcome

After the right personnel is assembled and an open culture is cultivated, teams must be built to optimize productivity. Admittedly, my experience in this field is lacking. I have only worked on engineering teams, so my preferences are distinctly focused on creativity, agility and system familiarity. I believe that teams should be interdisciplinary. If a project touches multiple components, at least one person who is familiar with each component should be involved in some way. If they are not a direct member involved in every meeting, they should be kept up to date with the progress in some way. Having workers with expertise close by reduces the friction that can come with working with an unfamiliar system. The teams that I worked with on trading projects were usually made up of 2-3 software engineers, 1-2 traders and 1 quant researcher. Depending on the scope of the project, I was put in direct contact with engineers outside of my desk or department who had knowledge of specific systems that I needed to interface with. This included internal tools teams and engineers intimately familiar with our pricing and risk systems.

I believe that leaner teams are the most effective. A diversity of ideas is important, but too many voices can make decision making extremely inefficient. Smaller teams can discuss ideas completely and come to a conclusion in a reasonable amount of time. Balancing a team with a wide enough set of experiences and a team that is small enough to get work done is difficult. Competency must be considered. If team members cannot consider effects of their decisions wider than the project that they are immediately working on, there will be a lot of pain and adaptation in the future. My team during my time with LifeBridge Health was extremely lean. We needed to work quickly to create working solutions for each hospital department. However, because our team was so small, we did not have an adequate understanding of the intersections between our work and other hospital systems. I often had to go to different IT teams in order to assess how our new databases and communication lines would interact with existing phone and fax lines, and how we could reduce network strain. Decisions made within our team were quick, but dealing with the repercussions was arduous. Optimizing a team's construction for the best and smoothest results can take a lot of time and planning. An organization might not have the resources to build the very best team for every job, so having people on hand who can make the most of suboptimal groupings will lead to the best work output regardless of the situation.
